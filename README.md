# walkie

A mobile application to track a users location whilst undertaking outdoor activities such as walks.

Users can capture photpahy whilst the application is running, create a full mapped route of the path they have travelled to and from as well as adding custom map markers to the map whilst on route to identify hazards such as low lying water, loose rocks, bridges, stiles, fields etc.

The user can then simply allocate a title to the walk themselves and also provide description information to provide more background for what to expect when undertaking the route. 

The application allows the local storing of the route data directly onto the device, which can then be uploading to a server database at the users request where it can remain in safer security and avoidance of accidental deletion.
